I'm such a fuck.

It has to be peer to peer. This server is the signaling and turn server, but it cannot be the RTCPeerConnection.

So each game will have multiple Rooms. Each Room will hold multiple users. Users in the same room will be connected via RTC.

Sometimes RTC is slow to intialize, though... is a 5 second transition between rooms enough? is that too slow to feel fun?

I'm hesitant to put the room-based muting on the client side. It'd be too easy to hack and give yourself global ears. But... maybe that's the best route for now...

FFS. WHAT IS THIS?!?!?!

It might be everything I need. WOW. Will have to try later.
