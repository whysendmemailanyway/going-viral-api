client calls the API server to get information about ICE servers and channel
server and client both perform these steps individually:
    create an RTCPeerConnection using that information
    create ice candidate handlers
client adds microphone track to output
server adds client input to output
client creates offer and sends it via websockets

the implementation is so open it's kind of hard to keep track of!
